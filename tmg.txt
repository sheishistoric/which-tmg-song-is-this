Going to Alaska


The jacaranda are wet with color,

and the heat is a great paint brush, lending color to our lives,

and to the air, and to our faces; but I'm going to Alaska where there's snow to suck the sound out from the air.

Up, yes, in the branches,

the purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;
there is meaning in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them

traces
of last year, but then they hadn't grown so strong,

and their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables. thick and alive with alien electricity, and I am going to Alaska,

where you can go blind just by looking at the ground,
where fat is eaten by itself

just to keep the body warm.

Because from where we are now, it seems, really,

that everything is growing in a thousand different ways; that the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives

who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise

to what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise? I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you, but they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them, then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska. They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes.

the garden song, 
        

I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom.
I see the flags are flying high.
I hear you've gone and rearranged things in your room.
I guess you're trying to cut-off my air supply.

I came toward your window, real slowly.
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil.
I guess by the now the flowers in your garden know me.
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil.

my bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt, moving up my ankles, but I don't fear you. the thorns began tearing at my shirt, but I didn't even care when they tore clear through.

your garden can't hurt me.
your flowers don't threaten my life.
your garden can't hurt me anymore.

the house was pretty and the yard was wide and I felt strong, with you at my side. your eyes at night, had a beautiful glowing in them. and I knew in my heart, just what was growing in them.

ah, but you made me drink poison.
it felt smooth running down my throat.
I love you. and you made me drink poison.
it was cool and smooth and sweet.
do you remember...

we had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard, and I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time. I tried to stop the thing metastasizing in us, but in the warm, slow evening, I could feel it rising in us.

ah, and you made me drink poison.
it felt so smooth, sliding down my throat.

the torch song 


        we'll just try that again.

the sun was coming up, and our friend was sound asleep. but we saw through the window, that the water ran so deep, that you couldn't make out, the ocean floor,

then I saw you in the light. I couldn't take it any more.

give me your hand.
give me everything you've got.
and the light from window will fall on us burning hot,
just like a torch.

the air was humid; I will not forget. when we stepped outside, I hear your footsteps. now in my mind, it's a soft sound, almost imperceptible, against the giving ground.

let me kiss your eyelids with my lips. let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips, just like a torch.

        I saw you at your window.
I saw you in the sun.
I saw you in the window, looking out.

I reached my hand in there, then I touched your hair and felt myself burn, in the morning.

and the chickens were screaming.
black dog at my heels.
and the bluejays were coughing up in the trees.

I'd forgotten my name.
I felt kind of ashamed,
and felt myself burn, in the morning.

at the beginning of summer!
and invisible stars, sent their heat down!

there was an ocean's droning,

though we were nowhere near the shore. we heard each other giggling and moaning, then we couldn't hear each other any more. yeah.

trying to yank herself right out of her orbit

with low clouds standing in the way and the stars jockeying for position

and you could feel his features in the air

a wide smile and perfect hair

he had complete control of the rising tides

and a medicine bag hanging at his side

with low clouds standing in the way and the stars jockeying for position

in the flowing blue world of the death-dealing physician

and the rain came down like water from a faucet I saw him at the crossroads, but I never saw him cross it, one minute he was on this side, and the next he was be over on the other. so went his rounds, one sad patient after another.

and I want to tell you, but you don't want to hear it

and then you started mumbling unintelligibly

the summer crawled by indetectably.

and then I saw you looking down to me.

and your earrings sparkled in the noon-day sun, and though it's very true that I love everyone, with every ounce of energy left in me, I love you especially because

I saw you, coming through the screen door on the second floor, up on the balcony.

it was hard to even see you at all,

because the air was thick with alcohol

so I kept on rubbing my eyes,

for all the good it did me,

for all the immeasurable good it did me,

let the years come and take away my memory,

I will not forget the shock that ran through me when,

I saw you, coming through the screen door on the second floor, up on the balcony.

Song for Cleomenes, 


        73 years before the advent of the Christian era, as Rome was taking over any land within reach, setting up proxy governments in the conquered lands, there lived one such man given just such a job. Gaius verres. go.

a praetor held a position which operated on trust.

he was to govern instead of the emperor himself.

it was an easy easy privilege to abuse.

and verres did so.

he was the governor of Agrigento which we now know as Sicily.

and he stole everything that wasn't nailed down, took improper advantage of other men's wives. the list goes on. trust me. cicero wrote it all down.

at Syracuse verres welcomed a band of pirates. they all drank and danced and sang on the shore, and when the husband of one of verres's paramours came bringing a fleet of boats with him, verius, clever, if diabolical, gave him a job.

and enlisted the pirates to burn the whole fleet down.

the boats burned in the Sicilian harbor the flames rose hundreds of feet into the air we stood on the shore watching them burn we stood on the shore, we heard the old songs. hey!

I remember lima. I remember the good life.

I remember lima. I remember the good life.

the window is ten feet high and three feet wide

sun beams bounce off the dark water

and come through the clear glass, magnified.

given to me by a friend whose name is no longer important

and I had a special feeling in my mind and I had a special feeling in my mind I had a certain glint in my eye, on the morning trouble came by.

there was a map of the American-Midwest on one wall. and there was a map of the American-West on another wall. and there was a map of Rome on the third wall. and there were maps in all directions. I was looking at them pondering connections when trouble came by.


then I stuck my head out the window.

the most remarkable thing about coming home to you is the feeling of being in motion again it's the most extraordinary thing in the world I have two big hands and a heart pumping blood and a 1967 colt .45 with a busted safety catch the world shines as I cross the Macon county line going to Georgia


the most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway

is that it's you

and that you're standing in the doorway

and you smile as you ease the gun from my hand and I’m

frozen with joy right where I stand

the world throws its light underneath your hair

forty miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere

going to Georgia

the world shines as I cross the Macon county line

going to Georgia

he touched me and suddenly...

it's a cold night in Sonora and the stars are out in full force it's a moment the world has been waiting for when you set the world back on course into the fire you go

into the fire you go

it's a strange gathering around you

and the lord of the snails is born

five minutes before you take on divinity

you hear the crackling, well you hear the snapping corn

into the fire you go

into the fire you go

and you told me what you were going to do and I promised to do the same thing too and the air, the air in New England was pure poison

the car was parked out back among the trees your voice was getting higher by slow degrees you were giving me directions

and you told me where I came from well God bless us, every one and the air, the air in New England was pure poison, poison, poison, poison

that woman set herself on fire

they said it on the radio

they said she lit up the skies of Palestine

I could not stand to hear them say so

I saw the stars come out

I saw the oranges on the trees

later on they played some Caribbean song man they sure know how to pick 'em the rich voice burning like a fuse the syncopated rhythm

I saw the oranges cracking open I saw you standing there orange blossom in your hair going to Palestine

Third Snow Song, 
        

in January I took a short walk

down to the Broadway bridge

two and a half blocks

when you scrape the ice away you can read the bridge dedication I can feel the cold air coming in through my teeth I saw the bridge

I saw the water underneath

that's a whole lotta water

that's a whole lotta water

I took out the key that I’d forgotten the function of twisted it from the keyring as the bridge loomed above I hammered it against the ice I hammered it against the ice

the powder burns on the eastern wall

there's a monkey in the basement how did the monkey get there? there's a monkey in the basement where did the monkey come from? where did the monkey come from? where did the monkey come from?

the animal noises you used to make the Andalusian coral snake all hail when standing beside this room and the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom

 Love Cuts The Strings, 


        the first thing that happened was the river overflowed the water running through the streets and was sweet and cold I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream


and then love pulled out the heavy artillery

Kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride

I count my blessings, but you can only be expected to count

so high

when love cuts the strings

I smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay you poked your head out of an alley half a block away and I recognized you, though I’m not sure how

and the air turned red around you as a dull chill came down over me

and then love summoned up the infantry

and the green-eyed goddess got ready for all-out war

and I’d count my blessings,

but I don't even know what the word blessing means

when love cuts the strings

yeah!

The Recognition Scene, 


        we broke the doorknob off of the door.
the door swung open easily.
we sauntered into the poorly lit store,
and looked around lazily.
we stole every bit of candy they had inside.
gobbled it all up greedily on our 3 month ride.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
you headed out to the getaway car
and hit the open road
I saw something written in tall clear letters on your face
but I could not break the code.
we had hot caramel sticking to our teeth
and the only love I've ever known burring underneath
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

I had your warm hand on my face.

I saw you shaking in the cold Korean air.

I hung by my hand from the tree outside
and I looked at the whole wide world.

set it on fire with your face in plain view
at the near window where you stood
watching me split the wood
I will do as I am told.
I will keep away the cold.
the fire pit in the snow
gave off a rich bright orange-red glow
a familiar scent rose up into the air
and I remembered something special from a long time ago
you opened up the door
stepped away from the killing floor

dry grass crinkled like paper as a breeze came in across the bay
cold clean water nearby, glimmered in your eyes
and your pistol glistened.
and the stars fell on Alabama
and your eyes filled up with light
and the stars fell on Alabama
but if you think I’ll take a bullet for you - you're dreaming.

Lonesome Surprise, 
        

doctor, doctor can you help me please?
all these pills and problems, keep piling down on me
(here's your lonesome surprise)
(here's your lonesome surprise)
(here's your lonesome surprise)
I had a name
had a place
but like the clothes I wear
the holes grow everywhere
'til it's like having nothing at all
(here's your lonesome surprise)
(here's your lonesome surprise)
(here's your lonesome surprise)
walked out of my shower, feeling more wet than baptized

Blood Royal, 
        

I remembered you.
I remembered where you'd come from.
I remembered you.
I remembered where you've gone.
in the shifting neon air,
saw the colors of the revolution everywhere
blood royal.
I remembered you.
I remembered all the things you said.
I remembered the shape of your face.
I let the thought go to my head.
in the iron blue dawn,
I felt power coming on.

The Only Thing I Know, 


        when you came back from Trenton,
all the sparkle was gone.
and you stood in the shadow
and the curtains were drawn
and I know you're lying.
and you know you're lying too.
that is just about the only thing I know about you.
when you pocketed your eyeshadow
and you picked up the phone,
stepped out on the balcony
and drank in the drone.
and I know you're leaving.
and you know you're leaving too.
that is just about the only thing I know about you.
when you stop on the sidewalk
and you looked up above you,
warm wet air came down to shelter me.
how much do I love you?
well you know you're dying.
and I know you're dying too.
that is just about the only thing I know about you.

Raja Vocative, 


        a bird you would've liked brought the sky down,
but it was useless to see it without you around.
and in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye,
I saw you and some foreign guy.
and I could hear your voice ringing.
and I could hear you singing.
from all the way across the country in palm springs,
I can hear you now.
your laughter tore through the new jersey night,
and I can't stand it, but I’m alright.
stood out on the balcony and I took a look around
and a bird you would've loved the sight of
brought the sky down.
and I can hear your voice ringing.
and I can hear you singing.
from all the way across the country in palm springs,
I can hear you now.

you had sugar on your stomach

you had sugar underneath your eyes.

I know that trick too.
I know what I means, coming from you.

      Short Song About the 10 Freeway, 
        evening came on like a big red wing
and the dying sun, split his colors on everything,

and you scraped your car up against the guardrail
and god is present in the sweeping gesture
but the devil is in the details

      Song for Dana Plato, 


        the 3 month ride sticks in your mind
as though the insides of your head were a big screen.
and coming in on an evening wind.
it's the unmistakable scent of brilliantine.
what kind of memory serves, what kind of world is it,
that comes headlong at you, then swerves at the last possible second?
it's this one. it's this one.
and it's easy to slow down.
and it's easy to slow down.
and it's easy to just lie out by the blue pools
in the squinting sun and slow down.
and it's easy to slow down.
and in situations like these, it's sometimes useful to
think of life as one long continuous evening
that never turns into night.
hey hey!

        hey don't touch the door.
because the door will surely kill you.
I hear you saying that you don't see what I mean,
well you better look again.
stop looking at the floor.
because the whole building's turning, and turning, and turning.
and don't touch the door.
can't you see the door's burning?
and all at once the street is filled with light.
and all at once the street is filled with sound.

      Papagallo, 


        you were standing near the water, when the wind ripped through.
heard your throat open up like a champagne bottle
I heard the one perfect song pouring out of you,
there was a darkening sky reflected on the river.
there was no way of determining where we were
low hills, colors gone crazy,
you standing like a ghost with the water behind you.
it's hard to grab ahold of some things sometimes,
like you need me to remind you.
you were standing near the water.
and I was looking at the water.
then you went down in the water,
and the river began to boil.
there was a minute when I thought I knew what you were about,
and then you opened up your eyes and the lord came out
low hills, colors gone crazy,
you rising from the water like a bird,
you had a pure song possessing you from shoulder to hip
and I recognized every single word.

      Song for John Davis, 


        the day we set sail from England
the wind behind us was fair
the day we set sail from England
there were smiling faces everywhere
and the snow came down on New Hampshire today
and the snow came down on New Hampshire today
the day we put the grain into the ground
there were smiling faces all around
and underneath the trees we planted when we landed
when I was a child
I spoke with the language of a child
but when I became a man, I put away childish things
and the snow came down on new Hampshire today
and the snow came down on new Hampshire today

      Stars Around Her, 


        I saw the darkness coming down,
it posed no threat to me
I let the darkness ease its way around
it was every good thing
I’d expected it would be
I saw you coming,
through the twisting vines outside
I saw the new moon collide
with the stars
clustered around her.
I saw the young fruit, on the new lime
I felt your breath catch it's rhythm.
I heard your legs push away the tall dry brush
I saw the moon and the stars
and knew the secrets within them.
I heard you saying
my name into my ear
no one has to tell me
why you've come here,
'cause I know.
I know.
I know.

      Eugene Sue (Like a Bullet) (outtake), 


        the car wouldn't start
and I had to walk
I headed out arrow toward the western rock
and I looked through the fence
heavy machinery shining in the moonlight
and a huge yellow tractor caught my eye
I heard the wheels crunch the gravel, I was feeling alright
and the tractor spoke
in drawn out syllables
the tractor sang
in long full notes
I’m getting out of here
coming to you like a bullet
I’m getting out of here
coming to you like a bullet
you gave me that liquid laugh
when I got home
as I tried to describe the bright yellow body and the shining chrome come alive
I knew you'd laugh
but that particular tone of yours just cuts me in half
you don't know what it's like to hear a big dumb machine spell out the details of your life

and the tractor spoke to me
in drawn out syllables
the tractor sang
in long full notes
I’m getting out of here
coming to you like a bullet

I saw the fox glove and the night shade.
I saw the cool garden and I thought a while about
how I’d been waiting for you since the second grade.
the flowers made the air boil.
the boiling air made me think of you a while.
I did not come here to suffer.
I did not come here to suffer.
I heard the ducks all quacking.
I saw the sunshine on the lake.
I saw you standing near the water

        well you walked into the party
like you were walking onto a yacht.
your hat strategically dipped beneath one eye.
your scarf it was apricot.
you had one eye on the mirror and
you watched yourself a lot.
and all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner,
they'd be your partner, yeah.
well you had me several years ago
when I was still quite naive.
and you said that we made such a pretty pair
and that you would never leave.
but you gave away the things you loved,
and one of them was me.
I had some dreams there were clouds in my coffee,
clouds in my coffee, yeah.
well I heard that you went off to Saratoga
and your horse naturally won.
and then you chartered a leer jet to Nova Scotia
to see the total eclipse of the sun.
yeah, you're always where you should be and
when you're not you're with some underworld spy
or your best friend's boyfriend.

it gives hard dark brown burning wood
when winter comes it stands right outside
with its blossom-laden arms spread wide.
the second new tree gives out sweet sticky fruit.
and it took a long time to take root.
sometimes we thought it had given up the spirit,
but now it makes me happy when I’m just standing near it.
the third new tree stands just west of the barn.
its best branches grow thicker than my arm.
I will water him everyday.
and I will chase all the termites away.
but the fourth new tree is my enemy.
yeah the fourth new tree shouldn't be here.
the fourth new tree
sets its tendrils through the water mains and tries to poison me.
his leaves are thick, always falling, and pure.

  Milk Song (unreleased), 


        when the sky was the color of cream,
and you started leaving messages on my answering machine
telling me that you were way across town and
would be home in a night or two.
I started keeping track of my losses.
there were only one or two I couldn't cover.
and up there against the milk while sky I saw
fleeting vestiges of you.
the way you vanished gradually
has made a bitter man of me.
and the way you vanished gradually,
has made a bitter man of me.
where the ocean cleaves the rocks real clean.
I dropped my answering machine.
I watched the waves chew it into tiny little pieces of seafoam hissing in the air.
in the balance sheet I’d been keeping in my mind
I entered two hundred kroners to the left of the debit line.
it was what the machine had cost me.
it was a greater loss than I could bear.
I hear the wheels and knobs whirring down to this very day,
long after the ocean has washed it all away.
I heard the train go by last night.
and it's a slow train outta here, alright.
but the way you disappeared in slow degrees,
has made a very patient man of me.

as we hang up the map on the motel wall,
count up the places that we've left behind,
add the distances in between them all,
all the bridges that someone's burned down for us,
all the chances that we burned all by ourselves,
makes us wonder what we were thinking then.

the sun was a red ball up in the summer sky.
I saw my sister standing in the doorway.
she had that look on her face that reminded me of you.
the reports were coming hourly and the sky was blue.
they were shifting the power again.
they always do this when I come home.
I tucked my shirt in, though I don't know why.
shielded my eyes from the light up in the sky
'cause it was shining, blazing, like a highway flare
in the incredibly impossibly dry air
I heard my mother call my sister to the kitchen again
and thought that everything was headed straight down the drain

I saw you watching me.

and you pressed your warm body against me
and I loved you so much it was making me sick

and I saw a wing shadow pass

and on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel
wheels were spitting out sparks, scraping at the rails

on the day that I become so forgetful

and the dandelions spread themselves thickly out
along the fields, which are, evidently, endless;
and we are hotly in love with one another.
we've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats.
we are, for some reason, all the time, bleeding,
and we are friendless.
and we love these dogs that roll on the lawns here in Galesburg --
because they seem to know something nobody else knows.
it is written in the smiles on their faces,
and it rings in their high young voices
we are burning up all of our choices up here
where the tall grass grows, up here in Galesburg.
the sky's opening up like an old wound,
and the rain on our bodies is warm tonight
and the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder.
we can taste fresh blood in our mouths again:
there is no chance of getting enough of it,
and we tally up all our possessions, we're going under.
but we love these dogs that loll in the rain here in Galesburg
as the new season rocks them in its terrible arms.
yeah they howl as though the world were ending,
and we are watching the sky unwinding
and some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form

I love you, I love you because
you gave me sausage and cheese when I was hungry.
you hold your closed hand out to me
and you told me to guess what you had inside
and I had a thousand guesses and some of them were good
but I knew for sure that I was losing my mind
when the scent came rising
through the spaces between your fingers
when the scent called to me
and I knew we'd last at least until the end of December
I love you, I love you because
you gave me sausage and cheese when I was hungry.

Can Dai Blowout, 


        he came knocking down the street lights
tearing up the new grass on the lawn
he was frightening off the livestock
I could feel him coming down
I let the Citronella dissolve in my hand
I began to feel real bad
when the ghost of your father comes to town
what the hell else can you do
I flung open all the windows
put the water on for tea
and let him pass right through
he took to knocking over furniture
getting into the reception on the wireless
he tore up all the dry goods in the pantry
he was strong and he was tireless
when the priest came to call, I sent him on his way
I got a tremor in my hands and my feet are made of clay
when the ghost of your father starts pushing you around
how are you gonna make him stop
I took down all the crosses, I let him set up shop

Korean Bird Paintings, 


        yesterday I put in a good 5 hours
talking to the statues
chased your memory all around the room
didn't manage to catch you
but I cleaned out the savings account
blew everything I had on flowers
covered up the furniture in carnations
rolled around for hours
there are those of you, who got the wrong idea right now
but man you should of seen me when I got through
indistinguishable from a fourth century Briton
waiting on the couch for you
I put all the extras on the credit card
mobiles of the galaxy and Mylar balloons
everything we'd saved up in one room at the same time
cartoon stars, crescent moons
thank you notes, get well cards
condolences, congratulations
bright colors, hues and signals

Narakaloka, 


        the cabbages that I will grow
one by one and row by row
will fatten in the spring sun
and breathe in the evening air
you will hear them breathing
if you walk by at night
you may not hear them after all
but that's all right
I've set the table for two
I've cleaned the windows for you
I've got cinnamon from Jakarta
for making French toast
the doctor says that I've got
thirty days left at most
the cabbages that I will grow
the love songs on the radio
will deepen in the springtime
they’ll be brighter than the stars

Golden Jackal Song, 


        well I swung through town
shining like a new quarter
felt something sharp rise up within me
when I crossed the border
stopped at the gas station payphone
I let my fingers fly
the wicked impulses were dying
but I couldn't let them die
and we were over at your place
singin' about the old times
no one had anything to prove
I ate so much carrion
that I could not move
I was bloated
when I saw you in the kitchen
glistening like the old country
all your cups and glasses
lined up in front of me
and I stopped at the faucet for a minute
waited til you came in to see what was wrong
and your fingers brushed my ribs playfully
and I played along
and you had your tongue in my mouth
your eyes glistening in the light
I ate rich raw carrion
til I couldn't think right
I was full

Treetop Song, 


        All along the interstate
the palm trees were calling out to me
the line of them stretched down the highway forever
as far as I could see
I waited til the sun was coming up
light morning traffic and a cool spring breeze
I heard the old voices calling down
from the tops of the trees
when I got up to the top, my head got light
for a minute everything in the world was alright
I saw the next tree just 10 feet away
give or take a few feet I guess
then I pushed off into the air with all my might
headed out into the center of the morning light
I knew that I was gonna make it
the new tree hardly shook to acknowledge my arrival
I knew that I would be alright

and you morphed into a housecat
and you all think I'm making this part up

up here they burn a lot of brown coal
and the cars all run on diesel fuel
the wind comes in from hills to the east
blowing thirty miles an hour at least
and the clear blue horizon is smooth and cool
and the house is like a relic of days gone by
and it's kinda hard to take, but i try
I've got a deep need to communicate
I want so badly to set things straight
but I can't seem to concentrate
deep in the heart of the Quaker state
i had the bed sent in from the west coast
watched the moving men carry in the old ghosts
and the purple-ink sky swelled up like a pregnant woman
saw the lights go up in town
on the back porch it began to cool down
but in here, in here, in here it was hotter than an oven
and the way my blood began to froth and foam
made it feel just like home

I remember the sound of your voice
but none of what you said.
I remember the burning in my body
and the buzzing in my head.
and I do remember your voice
smoothing over my only choice.
oh brave new world
that has such people in it.
oh brave new world
that has such people in it.
I can see the look on your face now
yes I can.
bright light dancing all along your eyes
and you covering your mouth up with your hand.
bracelets jangled against your arm.
no harm intended

oh brave new world

hey.
the air was cooling down
the sky was blue
I was heading north on Tailor street
when I ran into you
we stopped to talk.
right there on the sidewalk
the air was new and clean
I was inbetween times.
the mountains were clearly visible
and your timing was cruel.
you said almost everything right
and your eyes shone like little jewels.
we were talking
while the temperature dropped.
I was hoping against hope
that the wheel would stop.

when I came down from Harrisburg Pennsylvania
and I saw you by the highway
you asked me if the north was alright
and I said it got kind of cold at night
I could feel your bones shivering way down there in Birmingham
and when I came down from Harrisburg Pennsylvania

and then we set sail

and I apologize but I don't know what I love more

The Best Ever Death Metal Band In Denton, 


the best ever death metal band out of Denton
were a couple of guys, who'd been friends since grade school.
one was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff.
and they practiced twice a week in Jeff’s bedroom.
the best ever death metal band out of Denton
never settled on a name.
but the top three contenders, after weeks of debate,
were Satan’s fingers, and the killers, and the hospital bombers.
Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
for stage lights and leer jets, and fortune and fame.
so in script that made prominent use of a pentagram,
they stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names.
this was how Cyrus got sent to the school
where they told him he'd never be famous.
and this was why Jeff,
in the letters he'd write to his friend,
helped develop a plan to get even.
when you punish a person for dreaming his dream,
don't expect him to thank or forgive you.
the best ever death metal band out of Denton
will in time both outpace and outlive you.

she came in on the redeye to Dallas-Fort Worth.
all the way from sunny Taipei.
skin the color of a walnut shell,
and a baseball cap holding down her black hair.
and she came here after midnight.
the hot weather made her feel right at home.
come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
drink some of this. it'll put color in your cheeks.
he drove from in from Mexicali, no worse for wear.
money to burn, time to kill.
but five minutes looking in his eyes and we all knew he
was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we had.
we cleared a space for him to sleep in,
and we let the silence that's our trademark
make its presence felt.
come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
drink some of this. it'll put color in your cheeks.
they came in by the dozens, walking or crawling.
some were bright-eyed.
some were dead on their feet.
and they came from Zimbabwe,
or from soviet, Georgia.
east saint louis, or from Paris, or they lived across the street.
but they came, and when they'd finally made it here,
it was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear.
come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
drink some of this. it'll put color in your cheeks.

Jenny


you roared into the driveway of our southwestern ranch-style house
on a new Kawasaki, all yellow and black
fresh out of the showroom.
our house faced west,
so the big orange sun positioned at your back,
lit up your magnificent silhouette.
how much better?
how much better can my life get?
900 cubic centimeters of raw whining power.
no outstanding warrants for my arrest.
whoa-whoa. whoa whoa.
the pirate's life for me.
I hopped on back of the bike, wrapped my arms around you.
and I sank my face into your hair.
and then I inhaled as deeply as I possibly could.
you were as sweet and delicious as the warm desert air.
and you pointed your headlamp toward the horizon,
we were the one thing in the galaxy god didn't have his eyes on.
900 cc's of raw whining power,
no outstanding warrants for my arrest.
hi diddle dee dee.
god damn!

Fault Lines 
        
drink to your heath and you drink to mine
as we try to make the money we scored out in Vegas
hold out for a while.
we drink, vodka from Russia
we get our chocolates from Belgium
we have our strawberries flown in from England.
yeah but none of the money we spend
seems to do us much good in the end.
I’ve got a cracked engine block, both of us do.
yeah the house and the jewels, the Italian race car
they don't make us feel better about who we are.
I’ve got termites in the framework, so do you.
down here where the watermelon grows so sweet
where I worship the ground underneath of your feet,
we are experts in the art of frivolous spending.
and it's gone on like this, for 3 years I guess
and we're drunk all the time and our lives are a mess.
and the deathless love we swore to protect with our bodies
is stumbling across its bleak ending.
but none of the rage in our eyes
seems to finish it off where it lies.
I got sugar in the fuel lines, both of us do.
yeah the fights and the lies that we both love to tell
fail to send our love to its reward down in hell
I got pudding for a backbone, so do you!
la la la la.
hey hey!

Balance, 
        

two tall glasses of sweet iced tea
underneath the sweetgum tree,
and the love we once nurtured, you and me,
disintegrating violently.
stick your tongue out.
catch the pieces as they drift down the air.
I am too slow to catch them all,
not too far gone to care.
two slow summer hours spent picking at the bones,
figuring the interest on delinquent loans.
speaking in sad and mournful tones,
trying to squeeze tears out of mute stones.
wet your finger.
place it toward the wind.
feel disaster in the air.
we are far too slow to outrun it now.
not too far gone to care.

Pink and Blue, 


wind out of Oklahoma this morning smelled like blood and smoke.
and the crows discuss their future in the branches of
their Louisiana live oak.
the limbs are strong and heavy and its leaves are all aglow.
and the branches brush the upper air,
but the roots reach down to where the bad people go.
and what will I do with you, pink and blue?
true gold. nine days old.
nice new clothes on you and old cardboard produce box for a cradle.
I mashed some bananas in a coffee cup and
I fed you there at the kitchen table.
crows outside complaining about the finer points of local politics.
strange wind all full of new smells -- rust and fur and reception sticks.
and what will I do with you, pink and blue?
true gold. nine days old.

Riches and Wonders
        

we live high. our love gorges on the alcohol we feed it.
and it grows all fat and friendly
we have surplus if we need it.
we hold on as hard as we can.
our knuckles are white.
we write letters to each other, invent secrets to confess to.
I learn foreign and exotic terms of endearment by which to address you.
we feed fresh fruit to one another.
we stay up all night.
I am healthy, I am whole, but I have poor impulse control.
and I want to go home.
but I am home.
we are strong, we are faithful,
we are guardians of a rare thing.
we pay close careful attention to the news the morning air brings.
we show great loyalty to the hard times we've been through.
we are filled with riches and wonders,
our love keeps the things it finds.
and we dance like drunken sailors, lost at sea out of our minds.
you find shelter somewhere in me,
I find great comfort in you.
and I keep you safe from harm.
you hold me in your arms, and I want to go home.
but I am home

The Mess Inside
        

we took a weekend, drove to Provo.
the snow was white and fluffy.
but a weekend in Utah won't fix what's wrong with us.
the gray sky was vast and real cryptic above me.
I wanted you to love me like you used to do.
we took two weeks in the Bahamas.
went out dancing every night.
tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things.
most of the time I guess I felt alright.
but I wanted you to love me like you used to do.
but you cannot run
and you cannot hide,
from the wreck we've made of our house,
and from the mess inside.
we went down to New Orleans
one weekend in the spring.
looked hard for what we'd lost.
it was painful to admit it, but we couldn't find a thing.
I wanted you to love me like you used to do.
we went to New York city in September.
took the train out of Manhattan to the grand army stop.
found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago
when I felt such love for you I thought my heart was gonna pop.
I wanted you to love me like you used to do.
but I cannot run.
and I can't hide.
from the wreck we've made of our house.
from the mess inside.

Jeff Davis County Blues
        

after three nights in jail, I head north from Toyavale.
switch to 285 in Pecos, head up to Red Bluff.
my walk's real steady and my eyes are real cold
but I feel like I’m all of sixteen years old --
lost in the travel lodge, with the television on with the sound down,
I don't feel so tough.
old issues of sunset magazine to read,
sleep for twelve hours, and dream about home.
I have no place to go, so I drive up to new Mexico.
fix my eyes in the rearview when I cross the state line.
and I panic, I guess. and although it's quite late,
I take the first exit to 128.
I am coming back to midland.
I hope you won't mind.
polaroids of the two of us scattered on the passenger's seat.
I drive slowly
and evenly
and I dream about home.

Distant Stations, 
        

I found an old rock in the dry dirt outside
the door of my motel room.
it was a triangle with soft rounded edges
and a split down the middle of one corner.
it was darker than English moss.
green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume.
I waited for you, but I never told you where I was.
it was you who taught me how to write these kinds of equations.
I waited on the steps for you,
and I hid in the bushes whenever a car pulled into the parking lot.
you taught me how to listen to these distant stations.
distant stations.
I saw the sky break.
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rose bushes by the motel office.
missed him by a good yard or two.
I sang old songs from nowhere.
Los Angeles.
Albuquerque.
I said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry.
and I prayed real hard for you.
I waited for you, but I never told you where I was.
it was you who taught me how to write this kind of equation.

Source Decay, 
        

once a week
I make the drive
two hours east
to check the Austin post office box
and I take the detour
through our old neighborhood
see all the Chevy Impalas
in their front yards up on blocks
and I park in an alley
and I read through the post cards you continue to send
whereas indirectly as you can
you ask what I remember
I like these tortured devices from my old best friend
well I’ll tell you what I know
like I swore I always would
I don't think it will do you any good
I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
down toward the water.
I always get a late start
when the sun's going down
and the traffic's filling out
and the glare is hard to take
I wish the west Texas highway was a Mobius strip
I could ride it out for ever
when I feel my heart break
I almost swear I hear it happen
in fact clean and not hard
I come in off the highway and I park in my front yard
fall out of the car
like a hostage from a plane
think of you awhile
start wishing it would rain
and I remember the train heading south out of Bangkok
down, down towards, the water.
come in to the house
put on a pot of coffee
walk the floors a little while
set your postcard on the table
with all the others like it
start sorting through the pile
check the pictures
and the postmarks
and the captions
and the stamps
for a sign of any pattern at all
when I come up empty handed
the feeling almost overwhelms me
I let a few of my defenses fall
and I smile a bitter smile
it is not a pretty sight to see
I think about a railroad platform back in 1983
and I remember the train heading south out of Bangkok
down, down towards, the water.

Absolute Lithops Effect, 
        

after one long season of waiting,
after one long season of wanting,
I am breaking open.
my insides are pink and raw.
and I hurts me when I move my jaw,
but I am taking tiny steps forward.
and I... I feel sure that my wounds will heal.
and I, I will bloom here in my room.
with a little water.
and a little bit of sunlight.
and a little bit of tender mercy,
tender
mercy.
the big trucks come up the highway.
and the big wheels rattle my windows.
and night, night comes to Texas.
after one blind season alone in here,
after one long sweltering summer,
I, I’m going to find the exit.
and I will go to the house of a friend I know.
and I will let myself forget.
with a little water.
and a little bit of sunlight.
and a little bit of tender mercy,
tender
mercy.

And waiting for the dead To rise up from their graves Waiting for Jesus To come along and save us And biding our time Biding our time Biding our time as best we know how
Where the Texas doughboys used to play Before the wind blew everything away Where we came to get away from our friends Where we tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end We know our jokes are funny But in all the wrong ways And we rent old George Romero movies Relish the short time left
Waiting for the dead To rise up from their graves Waiting for Jesus To come along and save us Yes, and biding our time Biding our time Biding our time as best we know how

there's an old fallout shelter I can hide in

sky swallows up the city like a tent
young breezes' razor patterns in the dust

      No Children, 
        I hope that our few remaining friends
give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a failsafe plot
to piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I hope the fences we mended
fall down beneath their own weight
and I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope it's already too late
and I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
someday burns down
and I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
and I never come back to this town
again in my life
I hope I lie
and tell everyone you were a good wife
and I hope you die
I hope we both die
I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long
our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
we're pretty sure they're all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isn't over
and I hope you blink before I do
yeah I hope I never get sober
and I hope when you think of me years down the line
you can't find one good thing to say
and I’d hope that if I found the strength to walk out
you'd stay the hell out of my way
I am drowning
there is no sign of land
you are coming down with me
hand in unlovable hand
and I hope you die
I hope we both die

      See America Right, 
        I was driving up from Tampa
when the radiator burst
I was three sheets to the wind
a civilian saw me first
and then there was the cop
and then the children standing on the corner
your love is like a cyclone in a swamp
and the weather's getting warmer
I was getting out of jail
heading to the greyhound
you said you'd hop on one yourself
and meet me on the way down
I was shaking way too hard to think
dead on my feet about to drop
went and got the case of vodka from a car
and walked the two miles to the bus stop
got on the bus half-drunk again
the driver glared at me
met up with you in ingles
thumbed a ride to cedar key
if we never make it back to California
I want you to know I love you
but my love is like a dark cloud full of rain
that's always right there up above you
hey!

        I hear them squeal
I see them preen
fans all spread out
neat and clean
grab hold of the morning
head out to the porch
feel the wind stopping
feel the sun scorch
I fear for my safety
you can see it in my eyes
in an hour or two
we will rise
then a sharp breeze kicks up
I hug myself hard
how come there's peacocks in the front yard?
sun's all prickly
on my neck
when the helicopter passes
we both hit the deck
hands grasping and groping
seizing opportunity
right where it lies
the sky will fall
we will rise

somewhere just outside of town
about to burn down

my love is like a Cuban plane flying from Havana
up the Florida coast to the 'glades
soviet made

scrubbed clean and bright
checkerboard white and grey
towels from the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Kingston Jamaica
I can still see the rust colored stains today
the stage is set
someone's going to do something someone else will regret
I speak in smoke signals and you answer in code
the fuse will have to run out sometime
something here will eventually have to explode
have to explode
you and me lying on the tile floor
trying to keep cool
restless all night
sweating out the poison
as the temperature climbs
staring up up at the hundred-watt light that burns above
name one thing about us two anyone could love
we roll out the red carpet
when rotten luck comes down the road
five four three two one
watch for the flash

        from the housetops to the gutters
from the ocean to the shore
the warning signs have all been bright and garish
far too great in number to ignore
from the cities to the swamplands
from the highways to the hills
our love has never had a leg to stand on
from the aspirins to the cross-tops to the elevils
but I will walk down to the end with you
if you will come all the way down with me
from the entrance to the exit
is longer than it looks from where we stand
I want to say I’m sorry for stuff I haven't done yet
things will shortly get completely out of hand
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
in the tips of my fingers
in the skin on my face
in the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
in the way those eyes I’ve always loved illuminate this place
like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell

comes up to the guy in the superman suit
runs through him with a broadsword
I flipped the television off
bring all the bright lights up
turn the radio up loud
I don't know why I’m so persuaded
that if I think things through
long enough and hard enough
I’ll somehow get to you
but then you came in and we locked eyes
you kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
quickly lit another
look at that
would you look at that?
we're throwing off sparks
what will I do when I don't have you
to hold onto in the dark?
yes
everybody's going to need a witness
everybody's going to need a little backup
in case the scene gets nasty
you throw the attic window open
and I throw myself all around you
and night comes to Tallahassee
I don't know why it's gotten harder to keep myself away
thought I’d finally beat the feeling back
it all came back today
and then we fell down
and we locked arms
we knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
I don't mean it when I tell you
that I don't love you any more
look at that
would you look at that?
the way the ceiling starts to swerve
what will I do when I don't have you
when I finally get what I deserve?

if I see sunlight hit you
I am sure that we'll both decompose
ah the fitful sleep and the fire engines
that I dream of when I dream
some day we'll both wake up for good
I will try hard not to scream
the evening wind will shake the blinds
you're stirring from your slumber
we've got something hateful on our minds

for the dying of the day

humming like a hive

on accordion and banjo when the moon is high
and we lie on the floor
get suspicious of the people who've just moved in next door
the bad taste in our mouths
the twinkle in your eye
good things never last
bad things never die
wind chime from Tahiti that we found down at the auction
tolls its minor chord
and I can't think of one thing in this whole wide blessed world
that's more dangerous and frightening than you when you get bored
and we go through scads of money
don't know where it comes from, don't know where it goes

see the poison flowers the neighbors grow
sprouting up in nice neat rows
the swelling in our limbs

out on the ocean alone
and I scrutinize the carnage
like it was the goddamn Rosetta stone
when I crack
that secret code
it's sure to lighten my load
won’t you come out sailing with me
into the warmth of the afternoon
scoop up the guts and brains
drizzle them into a plastic bag
watch them drop onto the deck
feel the day drag
and when I get back to the car
it's like a furnace inside
I head on down the highway
throttle open wide
back home in the high heat
I spill out all my presents for you
there's blood all over the floor now

won't you come out sailing with me

when inspiration struck
and we knew it was high time
for us to change our own luck
we cracked a couple coca colas open
mixed them up with vodka and some coffee liqueur
poured in some cold milk and raised our glasses high to old friends
my love for you is ninety-eight percent pure.
but the two percent that remains
has fried the circuits in my brain.
I got out my smoking jacket.
you put on some fishnets and your smart black beret,
we cut quite a figure in the mirror
and then we were on our way.
oh would that you would kiss me
with the kisses of your mouth.
cause your mouth is sweeter than wine
and has a more complicated history than the American south.
as the evening
took us in
you could've popped the tension
with a safety pin.
we went down to Pete Brown Chevrolet,
cause Pete Brown satisfies all your new car needs.
we were nicely oiled by then

from well-worn ancient places.
our eager young sales rep handed us the keys.

we parked behind the high school away from the light.

comb through the carpet for clues
reflective tape on our sweatpants
big holes in our shoes

I put the pedal to the floor.
headed north on mills avenue,
and listened to the engine roar.
my broken house behind me and good things ahead,
a girl named Cathy wants a little of my time.
six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking,
ahhh listen to the engine whine.

I played video games in a drunken haze
I was seventeen years young.
hurt my knuckles punching the machines
the taste of scotch rich on my tongue.
and then Cathy showed up and we hung out.
trading swigs from the bottle all bitter and clean
locking eyes, holding hands,

I drove home in the California dusk.
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum.
picture the look on my stepfather's face,
ready for the bad things to come.
I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway.
the motor screaming out stuck in second gear.
the scene ends badly as you might imagine,

and down at the harbor, local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment.
and for a while there it was chaos
as they handcuffed and then roughed up some sailors.

and out behind the Chinese restaurants
guys were jumping into dumpsters.
and the stench was overbearing,
but they were past the point of caring.

I'll be down among the jumpers.
and when the birds come home in spring,

will cloud the rivers and the lakes.

and an almost airtight alibi.
down by the chemistry building
I found a quiet place to park.

climbed the steps up to your doorway
like a man prepared to jump underneath a train.
it's real warm outside tonight.
maybe tomorrow it rains, maybe tomorrow it rains.

and we turned on a fan.

from the rivers of Babylon.

and somebody stops to pick me up,
but he drops me off just down the block.
and along the highway where the empty sprits breathed,
wild sage growing in the weeds.
walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps.
heading vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes.
and I lose my footing and I skin my hands, breaking my fall.
and I laugh to myself and look up at the skies
and then I think I hear angels in my ears
like marbles being thrown against a mirror.
and along the highway, where unlucky stray dogs bleed,
wild sage growing in the weeds.
and some days I don't miss my family.
and some days I do.
and some days I think I'd feel better if I tried harder.
most days I know it's not true.
I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face.
and I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides.
and I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand,
'til it doesn't sting so much,
and until the blood's dried.
and when somebody asks if I'm ok, I don't know what to say.
and along the highway, from cast-off, innumerable seeds,
wild sage growing in the weeds.

        shadows on the broad lawn, canopy of trees
sometime after midnight, the ground is gonna freeze.
birds in the frosty air, what are they doing there?
greenhouse full of butcher's broom, breezes at my back
sometime before the sun comes up, the earth is gonna crack.
I look down at my hands, like they were mirrors.
fresh coffee at sunrise, warm my lips against the cup.

      Half Dead, 
        it was raining outside, so I cleaned house today.
spent half of the morning throwing old things away.
try not to get caught up,
try to think like a machine.
focus in on the task, try not to think about what it means.
can't get you out of my head.
lost without you,
half dead.
took my spot at the window, looked out at the road.
dots and dashes of traffic, like a messaging code
of whole boxes of memories wrapped up at the curb,
I sang songs to myself that didn't have any words.
can't get you out of my head.
lost without you,
half dead.
stole out to the backyard late last night.
pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight,
rising like giants from the cold earth.
what are the years we gave each other ever gonna be worth?
can't get you out of my head.
lost without you,

        I will rise up early and dress myself up nice
and I will leave the house and check the deadlock twice.
and I will find a crowd and blend in for a minute
and I will try to find a little comfort in it.
and I will get lonely and gasp for air.
and send your name up from my lips like a signal flare.
and I will go downtown, stand in the shadows of the buildings
and button up my coat, trying to stay strong, spirit willing.
and I will come back home, maybe call some friends,
maybe paint some pictures,

and I will get lonely and gasp for air.

      Maybe Sprout Wings, 
        a bad dream shook me in my sleep and I woke up sweating.
ran through the dark to the shower,
already forgetting.
tried to think good thoughts.
trying to find my way clear.
let the room fill with steam,
traced pictures on the mirror.
ghosts and clouds and nameless things.
squint your eyes and hope real hard,
maybe sprout wings.
I clawed my way to the living room window,
stood there in the cold.
the last bits of my dream like figures in the distance,
hard to hold.
I thought of old friends,
the ones who'd gone missing.
said all their names three times.
phantoms in the early dark,
canaries in the mines.
ghosts and clouds and nameless things.

      Moon Over Goldsboro, 
        I went down the gas station for no particular reason,
heard the screams from the high school --
it's football season.
empty lot the station faces, will probably be there forever.
I climbed over the four foot fence,
I was trying to sever the tether.
moon in the sky, cold as a stone
spend each night in your arms, always wake up alone.
I lay down in the weeds, it was a real cold night.
I was happy until the overnight attendant switched on the floodlight.
walking home I was talking to you under my breath,
saying things I would never say directly.
I heard a siren on the road highway ahead.
kinda wish they'd come and get me
frost on the sidewalk, white as a bone
tried to get close to you again, always wake up alone.
and as I was crossing our doorstep,
I hesitated just a moment there.
remembered the day we moved into our small house
'til the vision got too vivid to bear.
you were almost asleep, halfway undressed
I lay right down next to you
held your head against my chest.
and a guy with any kind of courage
would maybe stop to think the matter through
maybe hold you still and raise the question,
instead of blindly holding on to you.
but we crank up the heat
and you giggle and moan,
spend all night in the company of ghosts, always wake up alone

      In The Hidden Places, 
        autumn came around like a drifter to an onramp
there were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain.
took to walking barefoot around town
melodies from grade school, kicking in my brain.
saw you on the crosstown bus today.
you were reading a magazine.
I turned my face away and I shut my eyes tight.
and dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light on dark hillsides
in the hidden places.
the brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house
and I got off at the corner.
pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands.
and I wished I was someone else.
and I wished it was warmer.
and when I got home, I thought about you.
like a desperate policeman, searching for clues
and I almost passed out, just then
and I shut my eyes again
headed for the dark hillsides
in the hidden places.

high in the trees alone for years,
practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons
watching them go where they will go.

fall through the air, hoping to float.
practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy,

      Woke Up New, 
        on the morning when I woke up without you for the first time,
I felt free.
and I felt lonely.
and I felt scared.
and I began to talk to myself almost immediately,
not being used to being the only person there.
hmmmm
the first time I made coffee for just myself,
I made too much of it.
but I drank it all,
just 'cause you hate it when I let things go to waste.
and I wandered through the house, like a little boy lost at the mall.
and an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space.
and I sang oh
what do I do?
what do I do?
what do I do?
what do I do without you?
on the morning when I woke up without you for the first time,
I was cold, so I put on a sweater.
and I turned up the heat.
and the walls began to close in
and I felt so sad and frightened,
I practically ran from the living room out into the street.
and the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend.
and the world in its cold way started coming alive.
and I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train.
and I got ready for the future to arrive.
and I sang oh

I will hide underneath the table in the dining room,
knees drawn to my chest.
when the villagers come to my door,
I will breathe shallow breaths from high up in my stomach

I'll be all tucked away with my face to the floor and my eyes closed.

girl with a cobra tattoo on her arm,
it's head flaring out like a parachute.

      In Corolla, 
        the day I turned my back on all you people
I felt an itching in my thumbs.
the salt air like a broadcast from the distant, dark beyond
when my transformation comes.
I went down to the warm, warm water
saw a pelican fly past
waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me
I went wading through the grass.
and no one was gonna come and get me.
there wasn't anybody gonna know.
even though I leave a trail of burnt things in my wake
every single place I go.
and it was cool, and it was quiet
in the humid marsh down there.
I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water,
felt it gumming up my hair.
the sun was sinking into the Atlantic
the last time that I turned my back on you.
I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under
it was the best that I could do.
and I said,
let them all fare better than your servant,
the reeds all pricking at my skin.
here's hoping they have better luck than I had down here with you

someone’s coming through the gate
when the doorbell sounds like an air-raid siren
I am lying in wait
people used to come around
they fish-eyed and they rubber-necked
anyone who’d come to visit now
is automatically a suspect
I creep up to the window
me and my buzzing brain
and we watch two Jehovah's witnesses
retreating down the lane
I’m not coming out yet
it’s too cold
leave me alone ‘til I learn
how to spin straw into gold
I put on night-vision goggles
work my way along the wall into the kitchen
as soon as the first snow fell this year
my finger’s started itching
and I locked up the doors
and I sealed up all the windows
and friends came by sometimes for a while
I never let’em in though
and then they stopped, and then they stopped at last
and now it’s just us three
these walls and the church of Jesus Christ
of the latter-day saints and me
and I’m not coming out yet

the towers line the highway and they cry
from deep down in their guts until they die

toxicity near saturation levels
I rise up and greet the day
see the serpents rising from the clay
you were headed down to Salzburg for the night
all my hair was turning white
you and your crew were good to go
so many people that we'll never really know
I saw the city men, they make me laugh
digging up the cables, cutting them in half

you spray down the windows, you wipe them all clean
and you douse your old clothing with fresh gasoline
and the ghost on your doorstep is soaked wet with rain
and he clutches his stomach and howls at the pain
and you can stay busy all day
he’s never going away
so let all the lights blaze, keep your heart light
play really loud music all hours of the night

I'm gonna break something I'm gonna break something today
and sweep all the pieces away
and I stood before the mirror then like I was waiting for a phone call squinting like a lost traveler in a thick fog but nothing clear came into view except for you just off in the distant horizon something hidden in your hand
I'm gonna break something I'm gonna break something today
and sweep all the pieces away
so I pulled my hat brim down over my eyes and preened and posed and tried my new self on for size
then I was out the door in the faint winter sunlight just a number in the crowd smiling at everyone ah, but who'd smile back at a face like that

        just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers
hoisting my body up atop the charred debris.
who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes?
don't even question your senses.
you can be sure that's me.
when all the pretenders to your hand lie dead across the land,
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
crawling around, down on the ground.
when the hail Mary’s you've been saying lose their savor,
just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in,
whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you
just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim?
it was their love you wanted, not mine.
but when they deny your name three times
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
crawling around, down on the ground.
and I will throw you across my shoulders.
and I will bleed and I will drool.
and the cameras will slow pan across my face.
and I will try to say something cool.
just as the hordes of thirsting demons close around us,
raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun,
who will that guy be holding you so high above them?
you know and I know.
everyone knows it.
I'm the one.
I may have failed you once before,
but this right here, this means war.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.

        out by the tracks where the sunflowers grow high and fine,
three sets of tracks: Steve and Rochelle’s and the last one's mine.
guy with a hat down in the weeds in a cardboard box
secrets to keep.
records to seal up.
kittens weighed down with rocks.
there was a little toolshed where he made us suffer.
back at the school everyone looks like the enemy.
and we couldn't sleep and I had the voices inside of me.
Steve and Rochelle and me down the well all semester long.
back to the tracks to try and make peace,
but the box was gone, was gone.
there was a little toolshed where the sad man made us suffer.

these ones here they are the pleasures of the spirit
and tucked behind a pornographic picture in a frame
the troops found the pierced heart and they all gathered near it
and the dust clouds bloomed in the dark
and the face gazed up from the frame
roomful of French troops in a Franciscan abbey
history does not recall their names
of the several things that you have to do today
you're gonna regret one
this generation asks for a sign
it isn't gonna get one
Bertha took the pictures to the priest
and the priest fell on his face upon the floor
and the story lived on for a decade or two
but no one really knows it anymore
but the blessed heart is seen in the airbrush
and the blessed heart is beating on the wind
and the bodies of the faithful stacked by dozens by the roadsides
stripped and scourged and skinned
of the several things that you have to do today
you're gonna regret one

and they donned their black robes there in the chapel hall
they said a brief invocation to their cloven-hoofed prince
and they signed their names in blood on the vestry wall
in Christ you know there's neither high nor low
and the void will claim all creatures small or bright
seal up the borders or let everybody in
in the order of the serpent, there'll be neither left nor right

get a sticker for our shirts as we head into the sun
proudly bearing the mark
headed down to the ark
the applicants went down to Oklahoma
and they hired an accent coach to teach them the western twang
and several post-born babies learned the hard way
vampires only kiss you when they've sharpened up their fangs, yeah
and as Minnesota fell, so went Missouri
we were meeting at VFWs in the snow
and we voted down the tax codes, and we voted down the war

sweet freshly scrubbed smell of the crowd
all the excitement in their eyes
we were all made young when he stepped onto the stage
like an animal escaping from his cage
raise the trumpet
sound the drum
he whom the prophet spoke of long ago has come
all of us too dazed to leave when it was over
dawdled by the vendors for a minute
gathered underneath a summer sky
I was hoping you'd pass by
but thought I didn't see you that day or the next
I'm pretty sure that you were there
making your way among the young and happy hoard
headed down to your reward

kept my head down as I looked past the people
and in the dept. store
I found what I was looking for
this is the church.
this is the crucible.
they come out to Broadway and they look for me
I'm on the red steps smoking a cigarette
easy to recognize black bandages on my eyes
this is the church.
these are the congregants.
sun sets on the broad square and lights come up
feel like this town's gonna put a quick end to me
but if I came here to drown
I'm gonna take a few people down.

bashing in the heads of tax collectors
and anybody else who's in our way
bathing in the sunlight that's our birthright
waiting for someone to set the scene
last time he came to town a few stray coins came raining down
we scrambled in the dirt for them like ants around the queen
we take aim for the dawning day
and we shoot
starving to death
starving to death for the low hanging fruit
then all at once here comes the motorcade
slow and steady down the beaten track
and as we're bashing out the windows of the limo
we notice there's nobody in the back
and the helicopter lands atop the palace
the royal guard assembles at the gate

last among contenders of the super-featherweights

I set the sapling in the hole started gently tamping down the dirt I saw the future in a dream last night somebody's gonna get hurt, somebody's gonna get hurt
I hope it's not me but I suspect it's going to have to be
I dug my heels in for the winter and I waited for the snow but something was stuck up in the clouds, something was stuck up there I couldn't let go

young Romans at the city walls scavenging for scraps riding out the amnesia filling in the gaps
grab hold of my hammer try to bring down the Superdome on that rainy day when I bring my curses home
water floods the pharmacy people sliding down the aisles emerging into the moonlit night all smiles, all smiles
wished I was down there with them reaching for that third rail saw them on the TV though as they herded them down to jail

find a hollow branch to rest in slip inside wait for mice to poke their heads in jaw hinged open wide
hang by my tail listening for the call
'cause someday, someday the call will sound we all, all
are gonna get up from the ground
feel the wet leaves pressed against me cling like drowning men try to hoist myself upright
again, try again
hold on to the memories all night
and where my arms and legs once sprouted skin is smooth and slick rub the smooth spots on some rough rocks I feel cold and sick
hold on to the battle plan hold tight

I kept my hat on just for luck sang simple tunes the whole night through I wondered if I'd wake to find myself in flames as I waited here for you
yeah, when you came in I could breathe again
I saw some guys dressed up like sorcerers blue robes that float above the ground they came and went and I was frightened for my life I tried not to make a sound
just when my solitude was closing in I heard a howl like screeching tires and I told you the one thing I know how to say through the bright ringing drone of eight-bit choirs

every time in this house someone opens up his mouth
all his hopes and dreams begin their dizzy journey south
when the pipes began to freeze we turned on all the taps
tearing a good thing to pieces, bickering over the scraps
fried clams from the diner, diesel on the wind
gorge ourselves on caviar when the boat comes in
wait for someone neutral to reckon up the score
grease on the walls of the kitchen, dried blood on the living room floor

light cascading through the windows

drunk on the spirit and high on fumes
checked into a red roof inn
stayed up for several hours and then slept like infants
in the burning fuselage of my days
let my mouth be ever fresh with praise
he has fixed his sign in the sky
he has raised me from the pit and set me high

is lined with neuroleptics and electric shocks

wake and rise and face the day and try to stop the day from staring back at me
busy hours for joyful hearts and later maybe head out to the pharmacy
won't take the medication but it's good to have around
a kind and loving god won't let my small ship run aground
if you will believe in your heart
and confess with your lips
surely you will be saved one day

      1 John 4:16, 
        in the holding tank I built for myself it's feeding time
and I start to feel afraid 'cause I’m the last one left in line
the endless string of summer storms that led me to today
began one afternoon with you long ago and faraway
and someone leads the beast in on its chain
but I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain
so I won’t be afraid of anything ever again
in the cell that holds my body back the door swings wide
and I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside
and if the clouds are gathering, it's just to point the way
to an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day
and someone leads the beast in on its chain
but I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain
so I won’t be afraid of anything ever again

to a fentanyl drip
to mitigate the pain a little bit

from Pennsylvania
when I heard the hour was coming fast
and I docked in San Barbara
tried to brace myself
but you can't brace yourself
when the time comes
you just have to roll with the blast
and I’m an eighteen-wheeler headed down the interstate
and my breaks are going to give
and I won't know till it's too late
tires screaming when I lose control
try not to hurt too many people when I roll
find the harbor freeway
and head south
real tired
head kind of light
I found telegraph road
I’d only seen the name on envelopes
found the parking lot
and turned right
I felt all the details
carving out space in my head
Tropicana’s on the walk way
neon red
between the pain and the pills trying to hold at bay
stands a traveler going far away
and I am airplane tumbling wing over wing
tried to listen to my instruments
they don't say anything
people screaming when the engines quit
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit
and then came to your bedside
and as it turns out
I’m not ready
and as though
you were speaking through a thick haze
you said hello to me
we all stood there around you
happy to hear you speak
the last of something bright burning
still burning
beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy
and you were a presence full of light upon this earth
and I am a witness to your life and to its worth

and there's nobody around to break my fall

feel in my bones just what the future has in store
I pace in circles so the camera will see
look hard at my stripes, there'll be no more after me
laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark
scratch out a place to sit and rest down in the dark
smell something burning downwind just a little ways
they set up camp and sing and sweat and work for days
I have no fear of anyone I’m dumb and wild and free
I am a flightless bird and there'll be no more after me
in Costa Rica in a burrow underground
climb to the surface, blink my eyes and look around
I’m all alone here as I try my tiny song
claim my place beneath the sky but I won't be here for long

in these last hours if the spirit waits in check help me let it go
and should my suffering double let me never love you less
let every knee be bent, and every tongue confess
and I won't get better but someday I’ll be free
'cause I am not this body that imprisons me
I read the magazines somebody brought
hold them to my failing eyes until my hands get hot
and when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes
the pain begins to travel, dancing as it goes
and I won't get better but someday I’ll be free
'cause I am not this body that imprisons me
if my prayer goes unanswered that's alright
if my path fills with darkness and there is no sign of light
let me praise you for the good times, let me hold your banner high
until the hills are flattened and the rivers all run dry

drive 'til the rain stops
keep driving
pull over and blast off when I get the chance
clear as an insect's wings in sunlight
flip on the high stakes radio
try to sing the words right

two hopeful people looking at me that way

you both escaped the curse
you can't comprehend what it's like
we stood in the sunlight and they asked me where I’d been
held the gate open, told me to come on in
I saw the damp green grass so nice on the other side
couldn't explain myself to them but I tried

reined in 'til next week at the earliest
go through an old box full of Betamax tapes
pull the blankets up to my neck
and the screen began to glow
I cried real tears when they beat Chuck Norris down
wait here in the shadows 'til the shadows let me go
and treat each crushing moment like a gift
and wait for the fog to lift
pretend I’m waiting for a notice
from someone somewhere far away
sit here and break things while I’m waiting

it takes a crowd to drown a witch
so he said to us when he wriggled free and got the gun from me
standing before us, his cracking voice rising in pitch
and then the blood that's been spilling from his eyes
soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face
and just before he walks backwards through the wall
he pivots 45 degrees to face us all
and he says
let him who has eyes to see
take a good look at me
I’m a Mylar sheet hanging in the sun

is not arrayed like these
who have come to walk before us
rising from their knees
fighting back against their captors
calling down the curse
like this man whose substance is malleable
screaming out chapter and verse

when I’ve got something on my mind
and I don't want to squander the moment

people were mean to you
but I always thought you were cool

in your spiked heels
back in high school

it's better to pass on through those years and come out the other side
with our hearts still beating
having stared down demons
come back breathing

but I always thought you were cool

in your spiked heels

someone's got to say it sometime because it's true
people should have told you you were awesome
instead of taking advantage of you

like I love mine
I hope the painful memories only flex their power over you a little of the time
we held on to hope of better days coming
and when we did we were right
I hope the people who did you wrong
have trouble sleeping at night

that flowered in later days
to the folly of their learning

emerging from the maze

which was all anyone would
ever know about me
after my visitors got done with me
I lay down singing on the porch
blood streaming from my mouth
sounded kind of like Paul Westerberg
but to tell you the truth
I got lost out there in New Mexico
nothing to lose nowhere to go
I got lost
when my lucky stars crossed

      Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece, 
        lob some spit at the window
watch it drop down the pane
it's only the guilty
who concern themselves
with clearing their names
you bring tidings of hope,
false tidings
when you come here
there's two friends who did me wrong
that you're protecting
it's so clear
and when you speak it's those two
who speak through you
who'll speak for me?
the burning and the electricity
sun goes down San Francisco
friends are hard to find
chew them up just as quick
as I can find them
try to clear my mind
remember hours at the table
gauze flight light easing through
if there's one thing
that I'm not going to do tonight
it's die for you
'cause when you speak it's those two
who speak through you
who'll speak for me

        do every stupid thing that makes you feel alive
do every stupid thing to try to drive the dark away
let people call you crazy for the choices that you make
climb limits past the limits
jump in front of trains all day
and stay alive
just stay alive
play with matches if you think you need to play with matches
seek out the hidden places where the fire burns hot and bright
find where the heat's unbearable and stay there if you have to
don't hurt anybody on your way up to the light
and stay alive
just stay alive
people might laugh at your tattoos
when they do get new ones in completely garish hues

I am happy where the vermin play
make up magic spells

find the one safe way

      Lakeside View Apartments Suite, 
        downtown north past the airport
a dream in switchgrass and concrete
three gray floors of smoky windows
facing the street
Michael pulls the blinds back up
stares blankly down at the intersection
watching for the guy who's got the angel dust
crystal clear connection
days like dominoes
all in a line
we cheer for the home team every time
lakeside view, lakeside view
lakeside view for my whole crew
most nights now sleep in the kitchen
keep my face cool on the floor
and john, john comes by to drop off his envelopes
still playing postman after all these years
pull down my army surplus jacket
dig through some drawers to find the keys
emerge transformed in a million years
from days like these
under each eye little greasepaint smudge
you can't judge us - you're not the judge
lakeside view, lakeside view
lakeside view for my whole crew
and just before I leave
I throw up in the sink
one whole life recorded
in disappearing ink
and ray left a message thumbtacked to the door
I don't even bother trying to read them anymore

how bad they'll make you feel
sometimes you try to freeze time
'til those thoughts are a blur of spinning wheels
but I am just a broken machine
and I do things that I don't really mean

I’m still here, but all is lost
speed up to the precipice
and then slam on the brakes
some people crash two or three times
and then learn from their mistakes
but we are the ones who don't slow down at all
and there's nobody there to catch us when we fall
long black night, morning frost
I’m still here, but all is lost
feel the storm every night, hope it passes by
hallucinate a shady grove where Judas went to die
unfurl the black velvet altar cloth
draw a white chalk Baphomet
mistreat your altar boys long enough
and this is what you get
sad and angry, can't learn how to behave
still won't know how in the darkness of the grave

just a pair of tunes to hammer out
everybody's off the clock by ten

feels so free when I hit the avenue

get pretty sentimental now and then
the loneliest people in the whole wide world are the ones you're never going to see again

And some no one from the future remembers that you're gone
armies massing in the dusky distance
ghosted in the ribbon microphone
leave a little mark on something, maybe
take the secret circuit home
nothing in the shadows but the shadow hands
reaching out to sad, young, frightened men

burn the tree line down
hold my hopes underwater
stand there and watch them drown
fishing out their bodies
from the bathroom sink
leave them in a bucket
til they start to stink

she's only passing through
probably never see her again in this life I guess
not sure what I’m gonna do

because the small dark corners have designs on me
live like an outlaw
clutching gold coins in his claw
room full of ambitious young policemen
everybody trying to make his mark

and then the room went dark
dream of maybe waking up someday
and wanting you less than I do
this is a dream though
it's never gonna come true

because the small dark corners are establishing a colony
live like an outlaw
clutching gold coins in his claw
can't ever set aside the sweetness
of the days before the crews put up the border
fields full of wet rain
cling tight to their memory forever
think about Montana when I close my eyes
possibly Jenny's headed east
count a couple of stray hopes out loud
may their numbers one day be increased

and make a great big mess
wait where shadows mask or hide my scent
so many so-called friends
working for the government

and watch for the cars

map a path from here to home
can't quite catch em all

and turn the other way
wait for the coming disaster
I could do this all day

and left me to the tender cares of my faceless enemy

look for a tree to lean up against
whistle a tune-less tune
this may be the night my point-men finally come

cellphone stuck to the side of my face
dead space on the other end
perfect howl of emptiness
cast my gaze around the room
someone needs to clean up this mess
tape up the windows
call in a favor from an old friend
make some scratches on my floor
crawl down on my hands and knees
in old movies people scream
choking on their fists when they see shadows like these
but no one screams 'cause it's just me

about to get collectivized

like the mice in the forgotten grain
way up on the top shelf
like someone who's found a small town to escape to
keeps one eye on his abandoned former self
stay in the game
just try to play through the pain
like a fighter who's been told it's finally time for him to quit
show up in shining colors
and then stand there and get hit
like the clock that ticks in Dresden
when the whole town's been destroyed
like the nagging flash of insight
you're always desperate to avoid

I despise this town
snow on the sunroof
two stories down
hold hands
wish the snow away
rise in the darkness
of the gathering day

sing for ourselves alone
speak into
the microphone
cedar smudge our headbands
and take to the skies
soar ever-upwards
on air gone black with flies
shroud ourselves in the cosmos
let the music play
bright star of the morning
shine on his rising way
sing
in the night
in the nameless dark
father long gone
but we bear his mark
learn some secrets
never tell
stay sick
don't get well
clutch those broken headboards
ride the highest wave
dusky diamonds shining in the far depths of the cave
try to explain ourselves
babble on and on
by the time you receive this, we'll be gone

while the fire climbs

      Tribe of the Horned Heart (outtake), 
        you knew that they were out there by the signs they'd left behind
on old abandoned buildings, just some x's and some lines
half-circles in the concrete, crescents in the snow
you could find the little beacons almost everywhere you'd go
only people who were sick enough
knew how to read them right
I got sick when I was seventeen
and I'd hunt down signs all night
you'd listen for the voices in the generator's hum
hang out behind the power plant and wait for them to come
hints about their mission in the rustling of the surf
but no secrets can be kept from you if your faith is strong enough
only people who've been sick too long
can hold on to the hope
that some friendly ghost is listening to the prayers they learned to say
at the slack end of the rope

when they've got you under contract, break legs
when they're filling out your card
go hard
break legs, break legs, break legs
tear my insides up
with over the counter stuff
jump the turnbuckle and grimace
try to look tough
when you get a reputation, break legs
brook no insubordination, break legs
when the beer cups are raining down on you
do what they're paying you to do

anyone shot their movies there
we hid from the whipping rain
when we had run out of cocaine
dispatch down to plaid pantry
two on point, and two on sentry
ah, the joys that the lesser days bring
make you throw back your heads and sing
god bless all petty thieves
with tins of oysters up their sleeves
feast when you can
and dream when there's nothing to feast on
across a different bridge today
over the river and down Broadway
feels so good to have you here
some of you will be dead next year
I see your destinies above you
like angels who don't love you
let them kiss you and hold you tight
as long as the money's right
god bless all my old friends
and god bless me too, why pretend?
feast when you can
and dream when there's nothing to feast on
god bless the guys from my old neighborhood
gone past the point where any blessings can do them any good
attach the c-4 where you must
disappear in a cloud of dust
but spare a thought for what it covers up
pour a triple and raise your cup
we were here once, me and my friends
but we destroyed all of the evidence
and vanished into the night
at least we got that one right
god bless us, all of us
we who learn to shun the light
god bless all vampires every night

plot the course of the infection
trace from its beginnings to the present
is there no one here who's making this connection
feral cats out by the trash cans
to the true believer everything's a sign
scrape the pigments from the baseboards
in the shadow of the western hills
and paint my vision on my body
in the shadow of the western hills
bleak rose-petaled sky in two dimensions
black treeline a blade that cuts across it all
can't seem to sleep or find my appetite
since I got back from the hospital
call up Rebecca, maybe try to explain
but she hangs up while I’m still talking, I walk out into the rain
wonder from the alley to the darkness
sink down completely, leave no trace
trapped beneath the surface of the ice again
lie still with the moonlight on my face
wait for the wolves to keep their promise
listen for their footfalls in the cold

smoldering pieces landing in the yard
trace names in ash
big names, old friends
and dead ends
those last few frames
go down so fast
rise through the flames and end again in flames at last
stay free, stay free
invisible armies march by night for me
stay on my guard
burn hard
rage on
all gone
pause in mid-stride
pause in mid-stride
and ride and ride and ride and ride

      Unmasked!, 
        rain beats down, down on the outer walls
down on the skylight, where the streetlights
shine like unquenchable coals
and I’m up high, trying to say goodbye
the only way I know how
crude and graceless
peeking through the eyeholes
seeing the real you
and just after midnight
when it feels like it's getting late
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
crowd's half-gone, just a few hangers-on
come to see me finally tear through the stitching at last
and you don't care, you look almost relieved down there
like you're free, like you can breathe now
like they've sawn off your cast
just one more sleeper to see through
and by way of honoring
the things we once both held dear
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
cast of thousands
but we were the real two
and when I’m alone
before a mirror late at night
I will reveal you
I will reveal you

      The Ballad of Bull Ramos, 
        drive a great big truck
when I’m old, when I’m old
haul the wrecks down to the wreck yard
help the boys unload
keep my hair nice and long
because I can, because I can
any of my old friends who have no place to turn to
they know to call me any time they come through
never die, never die
stand with a bullwhip in my hand
and rise, rise
in the desert sand
work days, work nights
finally get laid up
by a piece of broken glass
on the floor of the shop
and the doctor recognizes me
as the operating theater goes dim
aren't you that old wrestler with the bullwhip?
yes sir, that's me, I’m him
get around fine on one leg
lose a kidney, then go blind
sit on my porch in Houston
let the good times dance across my mind
never die, never die
stand with a bullwhip in my hand
and rise, rise
surrounded by friends

      Hair Match, 
        you'll be maybe lunging for the bad guy’s hip
no one anticipates the sunset flip
the referee and your opponent will hold you there
and we're gonna bring in a folding chair
we'll stipulate that there will be no cameras filming
but of course there will be several in the building
and if by chance somebody hits record
and stands real still somewhere back behind the soundboard
cheap electric razor from the thrifty down the street
two guys down around your ankles so you'll stay put in your seat
buzzing razor held aloft and just about to strike
I loved you before I even ever knew what love was like
some people leave before it's over, but most of them stay
some hide behind their programs, some turn away
out in the parking lot you look up at the stars
and all the cheap cars

      Blood Capsules, 
        when the last of the east coast money ran dry
and the casually-dressed bill collectors
started casually dropping on by
and the residuals, but there weren't any more residuals
at least several months behind
on the payments to certain individuals
I strolled into the lobby
mouth full
blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
mouth full
blood capsules
I’m off the juice for seven months
I learn to like living clean
but there just isn't any money
on the independent scene
not even if you're cutting corners
staying in nights, eating alone
somebody's gotta pay the gas bill
it's not gonna go away on its own
I strolled into the lobby
mouth full
blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
mouth full
blood capsules
I’m the biggest guy in the bank line
everybody else looks tiny
I could almost smell the fear
on the lunch-hour car salesman behind me
I know this isn't gonna work
I guess I’ll see it when I see it
I can't work any other jobs
this was my last and best idea
I strolled into the lobby
mouth full
blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
mouth full

      Rain in Soho, 
        No one knows where the lone wolf sleeps 
No one sees the hidden treasure in the castle keep 
No one learns the secret name 
No one burns in the absent flame

No one broke DB Cooper's fall 
No one hopes to hear the bagman call 
Children piping in the main square 
But no one's dancing, no one's dancing down there

The river goes where the water flows 
But no one knows when the Batcave closed 
The river goes where the water flows 
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

No promise sweeter than a blood pact 
Nothing harder to go through with than a vanishing act 
No morning colder than the first frost 
No friends closer than the ones we've lost

Nothing sharper than a serpent's tooth 
Nothing harder than the gospel truth 
Though you repent and don sackcloth and try to make nice 
You can't cross the same river twice

The river goes where the water flows 
But no one knows when the Batcave closed 
The river goes where the water flows 
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

There's a club where you'd like to go 
You could meet someone who's lost like you 
Revel in the darkness like a pair of open graves 
Fumble through the fog for a season or two

No town more barren than our town 
No haven safer than the one they tore down 
No greater love than to lay my life down for a friend 
No sweeter pleasure than to see the credits clear through to the end

No one knows where the lone wolf's gone 
No one sees him camped out right there on the front lawn 
We played for you but you would not sing 
No one was going to get away with anything

The river goes where the water flows 
But no one knows when the Batcave closed 
The river goes where the water flows 
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

      Andrew Eldritch Is Moving Back to Leeds, 
        There's indifference on the wind, but a faint gust of hope 
At a club nobody goes to with a musty velvet rope 
Guys in Motörhead jackets who knew him way back when 
Haven't raised a drink in years but now meet up again 
To remember how it was when they all thought they'd move away 
And ride in Lotus Sevens through the London streets one day

Nobody ever gets away 
Even the best of us come back some day 
To the unmarked rooms where the dry dust breeds 
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

There's a rusted fog machine in a concrete storage space 
Letter-number combinations with no meaning on its face 
They won't make these any more, it's a wooden coach-and-four 
No one will even steal it if you leave it by the door 
With no sign to mark its going, no tombstone for its grave 
There will be goodbyes by dozens, so practice being brave

No one anticipates the rush 
The breezy feeling of the faceless crush 
At the ends of things where the salvage bleeds 
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

They don't throw him a parade 
He just comes in on a train 
One suitcase in his hand 
And an old army backpack 
From the second World War 
From a Leipzig second-hand store

Pick the keys up from the agent, everything's been taken care of 
No big changes in the roadways since you left that I'm aware of 
A few old buildings gone to dust, and some new ones in the way 
They'll look just like the old ones when the winds have had their say 
See the children bound for London, you'll all be back too 
Everybody tests the membrane, but no one pushes through

Come on boys, that'll be enough 
You'd think your old friends wouldn't play so tough 
Like a basket by the Nile hiding down among the reeds 
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

The Grey King and the Silver Flame Attunement, 
        

In the secret caverns underneath West Covina 
Half desperate for peace with the surface dwellers 
But coming to no conclusions 
And now we emerge, sky grey and misty

The Grey King in his new Pontiac 
Some of us sworn to the effort, trying to get our shapes back 
Teeth filed down to fine points 
Framework too tight, strain at the joints

And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore 
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore 
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore 
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore

Load into the Grand Am, doomed sailors 
Borne high by the waves, wild with wonder 
Leather and lace, and good friends 
Most of them good, most of them friendly

The Grey King at the rail, sparks flying 
Three of us in the car with him, scared of dying 
All eyes on the front seat 
Assuming his form, reborn in the heat

And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore 
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore 
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore 
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore

We Do It Different on the West Coast, 
        

The papers write about it back in England 
It's practically a lifestyle in Berlin 
There's probably some pockets in Ohio 
Almost always something happening in Ohio

I heard some bad reports about Long Island 
I don't trust what people say aout Long Island 
I heard some good things from some friends about Chicago 
I gotta see with my own eyes about Chicago

We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast

I heard they had a problem with some skinheads 
At a show in a machine shop in Pomona 
I feel like half my friends have moved to San Francisco 
I think I'm gonna bleach my hair this weekend

And Dave went to New York, I don't care 
You can't shut people up once they get back from their Christmas out there

Skim through such magazines as I can get my hands on 
Glue circuitboards to plywood on the weekend 
Trellis modulation for the children 
There's a whole new world just up around the corner

We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast

We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast 
We do it different on the west coast

Unicorn Tolerance, 
        

Drawn to the dark 
Covered by the blood, when possible 
Called to the corners 
To any open crucible

Easy to reach 
Bearing every mark unmissably 
Want to leave behind 
Some token of what I carried with me

Search in the stormdrains 
Sleep in the underpasses 
Try hard to look hard 
Behind my blackout sunglasses

But I have high unicorn tolerance 
I have high unicorn tolerance 
I have high unicorn tolerance 
I have high unicorn tolerance

Swim with real sharks 
Those who never speak when spoken to 
Hard limits fade into memory 
Once broken through

Sealing the well 
Every single day, instinctively 
Feel shame, real shame 
For what my friends must think of me

Dig through the graveyard 
Rub the bones against my face 
It gets real nice around the graveyard 
Once you've acquired the taste

And when the clouds do clear away 
Get a momentary chance to see 
The thing I've been trying to beat to death 
The soft creature that I used to be 
The better animal I used to be

Drawn where I'm drawn 
Seldom wonder why, just follow you 
Never blame the rags that swaddled me 
From the place the river took me to

Long life to the spiders 
Safe travels to the crow 
Love to the ghosts 
Who taught me everything I know

But I have high unicorn tolerance 
I have high unicorn tolerance 
I have high unicorn tolerance 
I have high unicorn tolerance

Stench of the Unburied, 
        

Incoherent but functional 
Speeding like a dead comet 
Purple crushed velvet waistcoat 
Flecked with Maalox and bits of dried vomit

Say what you will for the effort 
You can't fault the technique 
Still conscious at sunrise 
For the third time this week

But when the blue lights flash 
I know we're going to crash

And outside it's 92 degrees 
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Blaupunkt in the dashboard 
Cracks in the cylinder block 
Heading up the Golden State Freeway 
Toward Eagle Rock

Ice chest full of Corona 
And Pineapple Crush 
It'll take twenty years 
For the toxins to flush

And when the sirens wail 
I know we're going to jail

And outside it's 92 degrees 
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Follow the flame to freedom 
The flickering lights of Armageddon 
Find the foot of the ladder way down in the pit 
Keep climbing forever, try to keep the torch lit

And outside it's 92 degrees 
And KROQ, the rock of the '80s 
Is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Wear Black, 
        

Rain every day 
Fog all night 
Wind in the evergreen cypresses

See me, Lord of Wind and Rain 
See me, Guardian of the Underpasses

Wear black when it's light outside 
Wear black when there's no light 
Wear black following the left hand path 
Wear black when I get right

Waves at night 
Hard waves at dawn 
All this coast is vanishing

Check me out, I can't blend in 
Check me out, I'm young and ravishing

Wear black on your forgotten radar 
Wear black in the present tense 
Wear black when you come around 
Wear black in your absence

Wear black high as a kite 
Wear black dead sober 
Wear black when the trouble starts 
Wear black when it's over

Sun through the trees 
Head for the sun 
Can't find the path back to the main road

See me, Lord of the Thomas Guide 
See me, Keeper of the Source Code

Wear black to the intervention 
Wear black back to the car 
Wear black wherever I go 
Wear black wherever you are

Paid in Cocaine, 
        

Crusty boots in the corner of the closet by the tackle box 
Once proud shining silver buckles safe behind the normalcy locks 
Baubles and bangles 
A lost age 
Still all aglow with the radiance of the stage 
That's who I was 
This is who I am 
Work to pay down the interest on the mortgage 
Used to get paid by the gram

Long Beach, can you hear me? 
Can you hear me, Long Beach?

Long Beach, can you hear me? 
Can you hear me, Long Beach?

Master tape from the show we did at Fender's back in '85 
Dark paisley from Retail Slut all four of us still fresh and alive 
Flashes and phosphenes 
It's hard to believe that's me 
Strapped in, visibly sweating, as happy as I'm ever gonna be 
You're by my side 
Five years left on your card 
You're cashing out, all dressed up 
For your date with the emergency ward

Rage of Travers, 
        

Close the balcony and the rainbow 
Because the promoter says so 
Aviators and a buckskin frontier hat 
How come they dress like that? 
They break the news to me so gentle 
But I start to feel sentimental 
This used to be the place to go 
Still draw pretty good in Ontario

Nobody wants to hear the twelve bar blues 
From a guy in platform shoes

Let's just have a good time when the show's done 
Ask where the good clubs are and go find one 
Roll up to the curb, spill out of the car 
Everyone's dressed up like corpses 
I brought my guitar, set it down by the stage 
The singer's locked up in a steel cage 
Shaking the bars, eyes wild with fear 
I don't belong here

Shelved, 
        

I wanna ride the hydraulics 
Lit up like the north star 
I wanna wallow in the spoils before the crowd 
I wanna play my guitar

Not gonna sit up and beg 
Not gonna do tricks 
Not gonna stand here on a sound stage 
Tethered to a crucifix

The ride's over 
I know 
But I'm not ready to go

I wanna flash my pastel colors by the rail 
On a windy day at Pimlico 
Don't want to write songs with this clown they set me up with 
In a Los Angeles rehearsal studio

Not gonna tour with Trent Reznor 
Third of three, bottom of the bill 
You can't pay me to make that kind of music 
Not gonna swallow that pill

The ride's over 
I know 
But I'm not ready to go

Maybe dad is right 
I'm still young 
And I can write C++ 
Just as good as anyone

I know this guy at Lucasarts 
He says they're looking for hands 
In fifteen years I'll be throwing back beers 
With my feet in the sand

For the Portuguese Goth Metal Bands, 
        

Set the spectrum for the greyscale, that's better 
Favorite bold fonts in black letters 
Star-crossed lovers and their tragic fates 
And the one Celtic Frost record 
Almost everybody hates

Candlelight playing its tricks 
On the walls of the cave 
Hauling these songs to the light 
From the mouth of the grave

Mark the map out for the treasure, don't say where 
Find the octave in the shadow and stay there 
Sleep till sunset, stay up late 
Bleed bile all night 
Into an SM58

Candlelight playing its tricks 
On the walls of the cave 
Hauling these songs to the light 
From the mouth of the grave

Finally head west but it's a dead end 
Come home dead broke but still among friends 
Keep what's precious, drop what's not 
Without a second thought

There's not so many of us 
But you don't know any of us 
Work like a gravedigger, let the blood spill 
Headline really big festivals 
Every other summer in Brazil

Abandoned Flesh,

Any child knows how to do the spiderweb dance 
Siouxsie has enough hits to keep the bills paid 
Every New Year's in Los Angeles, you can still see Richard Blade \

But the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel 
Yeah, the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel

They charted once or twice, they were on a major label 
When the singer went solo he left money on the table 
The two main guys are related, they're at war with each other 
Now there's two Genes loving Jezebel, one for each brother

But the world came to agree 
What you see is what you get 
And what you get is what you see 
Whether you're The March Violets or The Bolshoi 
Bands who had to leave the darkness for the sun 
Red Lorry Yellow Lorry were on Cherry Red, I think 
They've been playing clubs since 1981

To be fair to Gene Loves Jezebel, Billy Corgan brought them on stage 
It was in 2011, it's on their Wikipedia page 
But for the most part, however big that chorused bass may throb 
You and me and all of us are gonna have to find a job

Because the world will never know or understand 
The suffocated splendor 
Of the once and future goth band,
